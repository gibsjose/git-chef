# add remote repository

> git remote add <remote> <url>
~ git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repository.git

! SSH (and a valid key pair associated with the repository owner) are required to push to the remote. However, you may also use the HTTPS url of the repository, which looks something like:
!   https://github.com/user/repository.git
